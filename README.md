# Norp Auto Browser
## A simple browser automation tool for the masses (or just me).
### What is it? 
Norp Auto Browser is a simple browser automation extension for NSWF videos, currently only available for Firefox users. 
It gives users the ability to select their favorite websites and tags, and then randomly navigate to a video from those selections.
### How does it work?
The extension will use a list of tags and a set of websites to randomly navigate to a video. The extension will then
navigate to another random video after the first video is finished. The extension will continue to do this until the user
clicks the "Stop" button. The extension will also mute the video, and put it in fullscreen mode, if the user has those
settings enabled. The extension tracks videos that have been viewed, and will not navigate to them again, unless the
video has been made a favorite and the user has the "Favorites" setting enabled.

### How do I use it?
The extension is very simple to use. 
```
1. Install the extension.
2. Click the icon in the top right of your browser.
3. Select the websites and tags that you want to be randomly chosen from.
4. Click the "Start" button.
5. Enjoy!
```

### How do I configure it?
The extension has a few settings that can be configured. 
```
1. "Favorites" - This setting will allow the extension to randomly choose from your favorites, as well as the tags and websites you have selected.
2. "Mute" - This setting will mute the video when it is played.
3. "Fullscreen" - This setting will put the video in fullscreen mode when it is played. (Not yet implemented)
